🎥 Movie Analysis Project
This project explores and analyzes a dataset containing detailed information about movies, including their ratings, genres, scores, directors, budgets, and more. Using Python and the Pandas library, we perform various data cleaning, transformation, and visualization tasks to gain insights into the film industry.

📁 Dataset
Columns in the dataset:

name: Movie title
rating: Movie's content rating (e.g., PG, R)
genre: Movie genre (e.g., Action, Drama)
year: Year the movie was released
released: Release date of the movie
score: IMDb or other rating scores
votes: Number of votes the movie received
director: Movie director
writer: Screenwriter of the movie
star: Lead actor/actress in the movie
country: Country where the movie was produced
budget: Budget allocated to produce the movie
gross: Revenue generated by the movie
company: Production company
runtime: Movie runtime in minutes
🛠 Features
This project covers the following steps and features:

1. Data Loading and Inspection
Load the dataset using Pandas.
Inspect the data for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
2. Data Cleaning
Handle missing values in key columns like budget and gross.
Convert data types (e.g., date formats, numerical columns).
Remove duplicates and outliers.
3. Data Exploration and Analysis
Top 10 highest-grossing movies.
Correlation analysis between budget, gross, and score.
Most common genres and their average gross revenue.
Analysis of trends in movie runtime over the years.
4. Visualizations
Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create:
Bar charts for top-grossing movies.
Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
Line charts to show trends over the years.
Pie charts for genre distribution.
5. Advanced Insights
Identify the most successful directors and production companies.
Analyze the impact of ratings (e.g., PG, R) on revenue.
Explore trends in movie budgets over time.
📊 Sample Code
Here’s a snippet of the code used for analysis:

python
Copy code
# Load the dataset
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')

# Top 10 highest-grossing movies
top_grossing = data.sort_values(by='gross', ascending=False).head(10)
print(top_grossing[['name', 'gross']])

# Correlation analysis
correlation = data[['budget', 'gross', 'score']].corr()
print(correlation)

# Visualization: Budget vs Gross
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sns.scatterplot(data=data, x='budget', y='gross', hue='rating')
plt.title('Budget vs Gross Revenue')
plt.show()
